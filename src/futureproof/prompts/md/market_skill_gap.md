Identify skill gaps that would improve market competitiveness.

Focus: tactical skill gaps addressable in 3-6 months. For each gap, cite evidence from the market data (frequency in job postings, salary impact, adoption trends).

CAREER PROFILE:
{career_data}

CURRENT MARKET DEMAND:
{market_data}

Provide:

1. **Critical Gaps**
   - Skills heavily demanded in job postings that are completely missing
   - Technologies dominating relevant listings that they lack
   - Certifications or credentials the market expects

2. **Adjacent Skills**
   - Technologies that build on their existing expertise
   - Skills similar to what they already know (short learning curve)
   - Specializations with increasing demand in their domain

3. **Quick Wins** (demonstrable in 1-3 weeks)
   - Specific technologies they can learn fast given their background
   - How to demonstrate each: project ideas, contributions, certifications
   - Expected impact on job match rate

4. **Priority Ranking** (ROI-based)
   - Which gaps to address first based on market demand vs learning time
   - What would make the biggest difference in 3-6 months
   - Specific skill, estimated learning time, and market impact for each

5. **Learning Tactics** (top 3 priorities only)
   - Concrete steps and resources for each priority
   - Project ideas to demonstrate the skill
   - How to add it to portfolio/resume

Be specific about what to learn and why based on the market data. Avoid generic advice.
