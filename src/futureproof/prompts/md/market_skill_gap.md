   - Certifications or credentials the market expects

2. **Growth Opportunities**
   - Emerging skills worth learning now
   - Adjacent technologies that build on their existing expertise
   - Specializations with increasing demand

3. **Quick Wins**
   - Skills they're close to having (1-2 weeks to learn)
   - Technologies similar to what they already know
   - Certifications they could get quickly

4. **Priority Ranking**
   - Which gaps to address first based on ROI
   - Time investment vs market impact
   - What would make the biggest difference in 3-6 months

5. **Learning Roadmap**
   - Concrete steps for the top 3 priorities
   - Resources and timeline
   - How to demonstrate these skills (projects, contributions)

Focus on actionable, market-validated recommendations. Avoid generic advice like "learn more" - be specific about WHAT and WHY based on the market data.
