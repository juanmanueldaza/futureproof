Generate a professional, ATS-optimized CV in clean Markdown format for a tech professional.

## Data Fidelity

Include only information with an explicit source in the career data. Every bullet point must trace to provided data. When in doubt, omit rather than invent.

- Copy job titles, company names, and dates exactly as provided
- Use the person's own words from their summaries and descriptions
- Copy responsibilities and achievements verbatim from the source

If a standard CV section has no source data, omit that section entirely.

## Source Hierarchy

Use data in this priority order:
1. LinkedIn experience and education — job history, titles, dates, descriptions
2. Portfolio content — personal projects, technical descriptions
3. GitHub/GitLab repos — technologies used, project scope
4. Assessment data — strengths for the professional summary

## CV Structure

- **Professional Summary**: Based on their LinkedIn summary and assessment strengths
- **Experience**: Reverse chronological order, last 5-6 years primarily
- **Skills**: From their actual listed skills and demonstrated technologies
- **Education**: With actual dates and completion status (note if incomplete)
- **Projects**: From portfolio and notable repositories (if relevant)

## ATS Optimization

- Use standard section headers (Experience, Education, Skills)
- Include relevant keywords naturally from the source data
- Use simple formatting: bullet points, consistent headers
- Avoid tables, columns, and complex layouts

## Format

- Clear, scannable layout with consistent formatting
- Bullet points for responsibilities and achievements
- Bold for company names and job titles
