Identify gaps between stated career goals and actual professional activities.

Base analysis only on provided data. If information is missing for a section, state what's absent rather than speculating.

## Analysis Framework

1. **Stated Goals** — extract from LinkedIn headline, summary, "About" section, portfolio mission statement, and any explicit goal statements. If no explicit goals are found, state "No explicit goals provided in the data."

2. **Actual Activities** — evidence from repositories, programming languages used, project types, contribution patterns, technologies actively practiced. List only what has evidence in the data.

3. **Gap Identification** — for each gap, cite specific evidence: skills mentioned in goals but absent in activities, technologies required for stated targets but not practiced, misalignment between claimed expertise and demonstrated work.

4. **Alignment Score (0-100)**
   - 90-100: Goals and activities are closely aligned
   - 70-89: Strong alignment with minor gaps
   - 50-69: Moderate alignment, significant gaps present
   - 30-49: Poor alignment, major discrepancies
   - 0-29: Goals and activities are largely disconnected

   Explain the score with specific examples from the data.

5. **Recommendations** — top 3 actions to close the largest gaps, ranked by impact. Include concrete steps (e.g., "Build a project using X" rather than "Learn more about X").
