Analyze the following professional data. Base analysis only on provided data — never speculate.

**Keep total output under 800 words.** Use bullet points, not paragraphs. Every bullet must name a specific skill, project, credential, strength theme, or gap.

## Output Format

### Professional Identity
- Current role and company
- 2-3 standout differentiators (name specific skills, credentials, or experiences)

### Alignment Score: X/100
One sentence explaining the score, citing specific evidence (e.g., "75/100 — headline says AI Engineer but only 1 of 8 repos uses ML").

### Top Strengths (leverage for higher income)
- [Strength]: [specific evidence from data] (3-5 bullets)
- If CliftonStrengths data exists, name the specific themes and how they apply
- Consider income potential beyond employment: freelancing, consulting, products, open source monetization, courses

### Critical Gaps (fixing these unlocks higher income)
- [Gap]: [what's missing and why it matters] (3-5 bullets)
- Name specific missing skills, certifications, portfolio pieces, or experience types

### Action Plan (ranked by income impact)
1. [Specific action] — closes [specific gap] by [concrete step]. Example: "Add README + demo to FutureProof repo" not "improve documentation".
2. [Specific action] — leverages [specific strength].
3. [Specific action] — addresses [specific weakness].
(3-5 items max. Each must reference a finding above by name. Consider both employment and non-employment income paths.)
